## Installation

If you want to perform Human sequence removal you will need [bmtagger](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/agarwala/bmtagger/) installed. The tools are bundled in the `mbtools` R package which also depends on all additional packages you need to run
the analyses. You will need to [install bioconductor first](https://www.bioconductor.org/install/) followed by running

```R
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('cdiener/microbiome/mbtools')
```

in R.

Alternatively you can use the Docker image which is built and kept up to date automatically by watching this repo. For this
you will require a [local installation](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox) with Docker or a cloud instance which can run docker (for instance CoreOS VMs on AWS or Google Cloud).

## Using the docker image

First get the image with

```bash
docker pull cdiener/microbiome
```

You can now start a Rstudio instance at port 8000 using

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8787 cdiener/microbiome
```

Now navigate your browser to <your-ip>:8000 (for instance localhost:8000 if you run docker on your machine) and you will be prompted for user credentials (use "rstudio" for user and password). All packages and dependencies are already installed here.

### FAQ

#### How do I change the password?

When starting the docker container you can pass an option setting the password.

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8787 -e PASSWORD="password" cdiener/microbiome
```

To change the password of an already running container login to the rstudio
account with the default credentials (user and password are "rstudio"). Click on
the "Tools" in the menu bar and choose "Shell". Type "passwd" and Enter. You
will be promted for the old and new password.
